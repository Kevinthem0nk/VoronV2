[z_calibration]

## update these variable according to the documentation here https://github.com/protoloft/klipper_z_calibration
## you then should call CALIBRATE_Z as one of the last lines on your PRINT_START to set the Z offset dinamically

probe_nozzle_x: 228   
probe_nozzle_y: 347

#   (above) The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the nozzle on the
#   Z endstop. 

probe_switch_x: 217 #
probe_switch_y: 321 #

#   (above) The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the probe's switch
#   on the Z endstop.

probe_bed_x: 168
probe_bed_y: 175

#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for probing on the print surface
#   (e.g. the center point) These coordinates will be adapted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh. It will raise an error if there is no
#   probe_bed site and no bed_mesh with a relative_reference_index
#   configured.

switch_offset: 9.03
#	Lower the number the higher the nozzle off the bed.
#   The trigger point offset of the used klicky switch.
#   This needs to be found out manually. More on this later
#   in this section..

max_deviation: 10.0
#   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
#   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
#   The default is 1.0 mm.

samples: 5 
#   default from [probe] section
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values
#   will be averaged. The default is from the probe's configuration.

samples_tolerance: .01
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.

samples_tolerance_retries: 5 
#   default from [probe] section
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.

samples_result: median
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.

clearance: 15
#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration.

position_min: -1
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The
#   default is from the Z rail configuration.

speed: 300
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.

lift_speed: 30
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's
#   configuration.

probing_speed: 10
#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.

probing_second_speed: 5
#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.

probing_retract_dist: 2
#   Distance to backoff (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.

probing_first_fast: true
#   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.

start_gcode: STATUS_CALIBRATING_Z
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   attach the probe.
before_switch_gcode: Attach_Probe
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probing on the
#   mag-probe. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be
#   used to attach the probe after probing on the nozzle and before probing
#   on the mag-probe.
end_gcode: Dock_Probe
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   detach the probe afterwards.
